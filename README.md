## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings from comprehensive end-to-end automated testing of the GoTrade trading platform conducted over five intensive days of development and testing. During this period, I designed and executed 8 carefully structured test cases spanning authentication flows, account management operations, and trading order placement functionality across multiple browser configurations.

The testing process employed a risk-based approach prioritizing critical user journeys, including secure authentication, multi-exchange account integration, and order execution with account segregation. The framework leverages Playwright's robust cross-browser capabilities combined with TypeScript for type-safe, maintainable test automation following the Page Object Model design pattern.

**Key Achievements:**
- Successfully implemented authenticated session management with state persistence
- Validated multi-exchange account addition workflows (OKX, Binance USD-M, Binance COIN-M)
- Verified order placement and account segregation across different trading accounts
- Established comprehensive error handling for negative test scenarios
- Created reusable page objects promoting test maintainability and scalability

**Critical Findings:**
The testing revealed both strengths and areas requiring attention. The authentication system demonstrates solid functionality with proper redirection flows and session state management. However, several observations warrant development team review, particularly around form validation feedback, error message consistency, and cross-browser test coverage expansion.

**Test Coverage Distribution:**
- Authentication Testing: 3 test cases (37.5%)
- Account Management: 4 test cases (50%)
- Trading Operations: 2 test cases (12.5%)

The project structure demonstrates strong architectural decisions with clear separation of concerns through the Page Object Model, centralized selector management, and modular test organization. Moving forward, I recommend expanding test coverage to include performance benchmarking under load, comprehensive accessibility auditing, and negative scenarios for trading operations.

## Testing Methodology

### Testing Approach

I employed a structured, risk-based testing strategy that prioritized critical business workflows essential to the GoTrade platform's core functionality. The methodology was designed to validate both happy-path scenarios and edge cases while maintaining efficient test execution and comprehensive coverage.

The testing approach was organized into three distinct phases, each building upon the insights and infrastructure established in the previous phase:

**Phase 1: Foundation Setup and Authentication**  
The initial phase focused on establishing a robust authentication testing framework. This included validating successful login flows, verifying proper session management, and confirming correct routing behavior post-authentication. I implemented a dedicated setup project that authenticates once and persists the session state, significantly improving test execution efficiency by eliminating redundant login operations across test suites.

The authentication setup navigates through the complete user journey from the login page (`/auth/login`) to the initial authenticated landing page (`/gotrade`), then proceeds to the admin dashboard (`/admin`) where account management operations occur. This multi-step navigation is captured in the stored authentication state, allowing subsequent tests to bypass repeated authentication while maintaining security validation.

**Phase 2: Account Management Validation**  
Building upon the authenticated state, the second phase systematically validated the account management workflows across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. This phase examined the complete lifecycle of account addition, including exchange selection, credential validation, test mode configuration, and error handling for invalid inputs.

Special attention was paid to the differences between exchange-specific requirements, such as OKX's passphrase field and Binance's test mode toggle. The testing strategy included both positive scenarios with valid API credentials and negative scenarios with intentionally invalid data to verify proper validation and error messaging.

**Phase 3: Trading Operations and Data Segregation**  
The final phase validated the core trading functionality, focusing on order placement accuracy, account switching mechanisms, and critical data segregation between different trading accounts. This phase employed sophisticated verification techniques including order table validation across both working orders and order history views, ensuring that orders are correctly associated with their respective accounts and do not appear in other accounts' order lists.

### Test Case Selection Rationale and In-Depth Analysis

The selection of test cases was driven by a comprehensive risk assessment of the GoTrade platform, considering business impact, technical complexity, and user workflow criticality. I developed 8 distinct test cases organized into three primary categories:

**Authentication and Session Management Test Cases (3 tests):**  
Authentication represents the highest-risk category as it serves as the gateway to all platform functionality and protects sensitive trading account data. I designed test cases to validate not only successful authentication flows but also to verify proper error handling for invalid credentials and empty field validation.

- **TC_AUTH_01: Successful Login with Valid Credentials** - This test validates the complete authentication journey from the login page through to the authenticated GoTrade landing page. It confirms proper credential validation, session establishment, and correct routing behavior. The test employs multiple assertion strategies including URL verification and page title validation to ensure robust confirmation of successful authentication.

- **TC_AUTH_02: Failed Login with Invalid Password** - This negative scenario proofs the system's ability to detect and reject invalid credentials, specifically testing password validation. The test verifies that appropriate error messages are displayed to users and that the application maintains security by preventing unauthorized access. This test is crucial for validating that the authentication system properly communicates failure states to users.

- **TC_AUTH_03: Empty Field Validation** - This boundary test examines the client-side validation behavior when users attempt to submit the login form without providing required credentials. It validates that the form properly prevents submission and displays appropriate validation messages, ensuring a good user experience while maintaining security standards.

**Account Management Test Cases (4 tests):**  
Account management functionality represents the platform's ability to integrate with multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, making it critical for the application's core value proposition. These tests examine both the happy-path workflows for successful account addition and the error handling capabilities when invalid credentials are provided.

- **TC_ACCT_01: Successful OKX Account Addition** - This test validates the complete workflow for adding an OKX trading account, including exchange selection (default), form field population with all required credentials (API key, secret, and passphrase), submission processing, success notification display, and verification that the account appears in the accounts table. This test confirms the end-to-end integration with OKX's API validation system.

- **TC_ACCT_02: Invalid OKX Credentials Handling** - This negative scenario deliberately provides invalid API credentials to verify the system's error handling capabilities. The test confirms that the application properly communicates validation failures from the OKX API and displays meaningful error messages to users, preventing the creation of non-functional account configurations.

- **TC_ACCT_03: Binance USD-M Account Preparation with Test Mode** - This test validates the exchange selection workflow and form preparation for Binance USD-M accounts. It specifically verifies that the test mode toggle is properly enabled (required for test environment operations), all form fields are correctly populated, and the submit button becomes active. This test focuses on form state management rather than full submission to isolate UI behavior from API integration concerns.

- **TC_ACCT_04: Binance COIN-M Account Preparation with Test Mode** - Similar to the previous test but for Binance COIN-M exchange, this test validates the exchange-specific configuration differences and ensures the form properly adapts to different exchange requirements. The test confirms proper test mode enablement and form validation states specific to the COIN-M trading environment.

**Trading Operations Test Cases (2 tests):**  
Trading operations represent the platform's core functionality for executing orders across managed accounts. These tests validate order placement accuracy, data segregation between accounts, and proper display of orders in both working orders and historical order views.

- **TC_TRADE_01: Order Placement on Default Account** - This comprehensive test validates the complete order placement workflow using the default Binance COIN-M account. The test inputs specific order parameters (quantity: 0.2, duration: 1 second), executes the order placement, verifies success notifications, and then systematically checks both the working orders tab and order history tab to confirm the order appears correctly with accurate details. This multi-step verification ensures data consistency across different UI views.

- **TC_TRADE_02: Account Switching and Order Segregation** - This sophisticated test validates two critical capabilities: the ability to switch between different trading accounts and the proper segregation of order data between accounts. The test switches from the default Binance COIN-M account to Binance USD-M, places an order on the new account, verifies the order appears under the correct account, then switches back to the original account and confirms the order does NOT appear there. This verification of data segregation is critical for preventing trading errors and maintaining accurate account-specific order histories.

### Tools and Techniques Employed

The testing framework leverages several advanced Playwright capabilities and follows industry best practices for test automation:

**Page Object Model (POM) Implementation:**  
I implemented a comprehensive POM architecture with three primary page objects:
- `LoginPage.ts`: Encapsulates all authentication-related locators and actions
- `AccountsPage.ts`: Manages navigation to the admin dashboard and all account management operations
- `goTradeSelectors.ts`: Centralizes selectors for trading operations for easier maintenance

This pattern promotes code reusability, improves test maintainability, and creates clear abstraction layers between test logic and UI implementation details.

**Authentication State Management:**  
The framework employs Playwright's storage state functionality to persist authenticated sessions across test runs. The `auth.setup.ts` file executes once per test session, performing authentication and saving the session state to `playwright/.auth/user.json`. Subsequent test projects declare this setup as a dependency, allowing them to start from an authenticated state without repeatedly executing login operations.

**Centralized Selector Management:**  
Trading operations utilize a centralized selector management approach through `goTradeSelectors.ts`, which defines all UI element selectors in a type-safe interface. This approach prevents selector duplication, facilitates bulk updates when UI changes occur, and provides a single source of truth for element location strategies.

**Multi-Browser Configuration:**  
The Playwright configuration defines multiple browser projects including Desktop Chromium, Microsoft Edge, and Mobile Chrome (Pixel 5 emulation). Each project inherits the authenticated state from the setup project, enabling consistent cross-browser validation while maintaining efficient test execution through parallelization.

**Robust Wait Strategies:**  
The tests employ Playwright's intelligent auto-waiting capabilities combined with explicit wait conditions for specific application states. Navigation actions use `waitForURL` with `networkidle` conditions to ensure pages fully load before proceeding. Modal dialogs and dynamic content employ visibility waits to handle asynchronous UI updates gracefully.

### Challenges Encountered and Solutions Implemented

Throughout the testing process, I encountered several technical challenges that required creative problem-solving and demonstrated the complexity of testing modern single-page applications:

**Challenge 1: Multi-Step Authentication Navigation**  
The GoTrade application requires navigation through multiple pages post-login: from `/auth/login` to `/gotrade`, then to `/admin` via the Accounts menu and Admin sidebar link. Initially, tests failed because they assumed direct navigation to `/admin` after authentication.

*Solution:* I implemented a dedicated `navigateToAdminDashboard()` method in `AccountsPage.ts` that orchestrates this multi-step journey. The setup project calls this method to establish the complete authenticated state, and subsequent tests can either call it directly or rely on the stored state. This approach ensures tests accurately reflect the actual user journey while maintaining reusable navigation logic.

**Challenge 2: Exchange-Specific Form Field Variations**  
Different cryptocurrency exchanges require different credential fields (e.g., OKX requires a passphrase, Binance accounts require test mode toggle), making a one-size-fits-all form filling method impractical.

*Solution:* I designed the `fillAccountForm()` method with optional parameters and conditional logic to handle exchange-specific requirements. The method accepts optional `passphrase` and `isTestMode` parameters, checking field visibility before attempting interactions. This approach maintains a clean API for test authors while handling implementation complexity internally.

**Challenge 3: Asynchronous Order Processing and Table Updates**  
After placing orders, the working orders and order history tables update asynchronously, sometimes with slight delays. Initial test attempts failed due to premature table verification before data appeared.

*Solution:* I implemented layered wait strategies including explicit success notification visibility checks, controlled timeout delays for order settlement, and filtered locator chains that wait for specific table row content. The use of Playwright's `filter()` method on table row locators allows tests to wait for rows matching specific criteria (e.g., containing "Buy" AND "0.2") rather than making blind assertions on table state.

**Challenge 4: Test Data Isolation and Unique Naming**  
Running tests multiple times with the same account names caused conflicts and failures due to duplicate account name validation in the application.

*Solution:* While the current test data uses static names, I documented the need for dynamic test data generation using timestamps or unique identifiers. For the current test environment, I included unique suffixes (e.g., `_yagya_test`, `_TEST_TM`) to minimize collisions. A production-ready enhancement would implement a data generation utility that creates unique identifiers per test run.

## Detailed Findings

### Critical Issues

**CRIT-001: Incomplete Test Coverage for Production Readiness**  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Browser:** All  
**Description:** The current test suite lacks comprehensive coverage of critical error scenarios, performance benchmarks, and security validation necessary for production deployment.

**Missing Coverage Areas:**
- No validation of concurrent order placement from the same account
- Lack of testing for network failure scenarios during order submission
- Missing validation of order cancellation workflows
- No performance benchmarinting for large order volumes
- Insufficient security testing for session expiration during active trading

**Impact:** Without comprehensive testing of these critical scenarios, the application may exhibit undefined behavior or data loss in production environments under stress or adverse network conditions.

**Recommendation:** Expand test suite to include concurrent operation testing, network resilience scenarios, and comprehensive performance benchmarking before production deployment.

---

### High Priority Issues

**HIGH-001: Form Validation Feedback Inconsistency**  
**Severity:** High  
**Browser:** All  
**Description:** The account addition forms show inconsistent validation feedback between client-side and server-side validation errors.

**Observations:**
- Client-side validation messages (e.g., empty required fields) appear inline below form fields
- Server-side validation errors (e.g., invalid API credentials from OKX) appear as separate error messages in the modal
- Success notifications appear as temporary toast messages
- No clear visual distinction between validation errors and API errors

**Expected Behavior:** Consistent error messaging patterns across all validation scenarios with clear visual hierarchy distinguishing field-level validation from system-level errors.

**Actual Behavior:** Users may be confused by varying error message locations and formats, potentially missing critical feedback about why their account addition failed.

**Evidence:** Observed during test case TC_ACCT_02 (Invalid OKX Credentials Handling)

---

**HIGH-002: Limited Cross-Browser Test Coverage**  
**Severity:** High  
**Browser:** Firefox, Safari  
**Description:** The current test configuration excludes Firefox from active testing (commented out in `playwright.config.ts`) and has no Safari/WebKit testing.

**Configuration Status:**
```typescript
// {
//   name: 'firefox',
//   use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
//   dependencies: ['setup'],
// },
```

**Impact:** Potential cross-browser compatibility issues remain undetected, particularly for users accessing the platform via Firefox or Safari browsers. Given that these browsers represent significant market share, untested compatibility could impact user experience and platform accessibility.

**Recommendation:** Enable Firefox testing and add WebKit/Safari configuration to validate cross-browser consistency, especially for form interactions and dynamic content updates.

---

**HIGH-003: Order Verification Relies on Hardcoded Test Data**  
**Severity:** High  
**Browser:** All  
**Description:** The trading operation tests use hardcoded order values (quantity: 0.2) for verification, which could lead to false positives if previous test runs left residual data.

**Specific Example from goTrade.spec.ts:**
```typescript
const workingOrderRow = page.locator('[data-testid="working-orders-table"] tr')
    .filter({ hasText: 'Buy' })
    .filter({ hasText: '0.2' });
```

**Risk:** If the order tables are not properly cleaned between test runs, tests might verify orders from previous executions rather than the current test's order, leading to misleading pass results.

**Recommendation:** Implement unique order identification strategies such as:
- Generating dynamic test data with unique identifiers
- Implementing data cleanup procedures before each test suite
- Adding timestamp-based verification to distinguish new orders from historical data
- Capturing order IDs during placement for precise verification

---

### Medium Priority Issues

**MED-001: Test Mode Toggle Visibility Assumptions**  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Browser:** All  
**Description:** The `fillAccountForm()` method in `AccountsPage.ts` checks for test mode toggle visibility but doesn't explicitly validate whether the toggle appears for exchanges that require it.

**Code Location:**
```typescript
if (isTestMode && await this.testModeToggle.isVisible()) {
    await this.testModeToggle.check();
    await expect(this.testModeToggle).toBeChecked();
}
```

**Concern:** If the test mode toggle fails to appear for Binance accounts (where it's required), the tests would pass without properly enabling test mode, potentially causing issues with API integration.

**Recommendation:** Add explicit assertion that the test mode toggle is visible before attempting to interact with it when testing Binance accounts, or implement exchange-specific validation rules.

---

**MED-002: Insufficient Negative Scenario Coverage for Trading Operations**  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Browser:** All  
**Description:** The trading test suite focuses primarily on successful order placement scenarios but lacks comprehensive negative testing.

**Missing Negative Scenarios:**
- Order placement with invalid quantity values (negative, zero, exceeds available balance)
- Order placement with invalid duration values
- Order placement attempt when not connected to exchange API
- Order cancellation failures
- Concurrent order modifications

**Impact:** The application's behavior under invalid input conditions or error states remains untested, potentially leading to poor error handling or confusing user experiences in production.

**Recommendation:** Expand test coverage to include comprehensive negative scenarios that validate input validation, error messaging, and graceful failure handling.

---

**MED-003: Page Object Locator Strategy Inconsistency**  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Browser:** All  
**Description:** The project uses mixed locator strategies across different page objects, which could impact test maintainability.

**Examples:**
- `LoginPage.ts` uses primarily role-based locators: `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign In' })`
- `AccountsPage.ts` uses mix of test IDs and roles: `page.getByTestId('add-account-dialog')`
- `goTradeSelectors.ts` uses test ID attributes: `'[data-testid="exchange-selector-trigger"]'`

**Impact:** While all approaches are valid, the inconsistency could confuse test maintainers and make it unclear which strategy to use for new test development.

**Recommendation:** Establish and document a consistent locator strategy priority order (e.g., test IDs > role-based > CSS selectors) and gradually refactor existing locators to follow the convention.

---

**MED-004: Timeout Values Need Standardization**  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Browser:** All  
**Description:** Different tests use varying timeout values without clear justification, which could lead to flaky tests or unnecessarily slow execution.

**Examples:**
```typescript
// In goTrade.spec.ts
await expect(page.locator(successNotification)).toBeVisible();
await page.waitForTimeout(2000); // Arbitrary wait

// In accounts.spec.ts
await expect(accountsPage.successMessage).toBeVisible({ timeout: 60000 });
```

**Concern:** The use of `page.waitForTimeout(2000)` introduces fixed delays that may be too short under slow network conditions or unnecessarily long under normal conditions. The 60-second timeout for success messages seems excessive.

**Recommendation:** 
- Replace fixed timeouts with condition-based waits where possible
- Standardize timeout values as configuration constants
- Document rationale for extended timeouts where necessary

---

### Low Priority Issues

**LOW-001: Console Logging in Production Tests**  
**Severity:** Low  
**Browser:** All  
**Description:** The `goTrade.spec.ts` file contains multiple `console.log()` statements used for debugging during test development.

**Examples:**
```typescript
console.log('Verifying default account is selected');
console.log('Setting quantity to 0.2');
console.log('Placing the Buy order');
```

**Impact:** While these don't affect test functionality, they clutter test output and should be removed or replaced with proper Playwright test step annotations for production test suites.

**Recommendation:** Replace console.log statements with Playwright's `test.step()` API for better test reporting:
```typescript
await test.step('Verify default account is selected', async () => {
    await expect(page.locator(exchangeSelectorTrigger)).toContainText(defaultAccountName);
});
```

---

**LOW-002: Missing Test Documentation**  
**Severity:** Low  
**Browser:** All  
**Description:** While the code includes some inline comments and JSDoc blocks, comprehensive test case documentation is minimal.

**Missing Documentation:**
- Test case prerequisites and dependencies
- Expected pre-conditions for each test
- Test data source documentation
- Environment-specific configuration notes

**Recommendation:** Create a comprehensive testing documentation file (e.g., `TESTING.md`) that includes:
- Test execution instructions
- Environment setup requirements
- Test data management strategy
- Troubleshooting common test failures
- Contributing guidelines for new tests

---

**LOW-003: Git Ignore Configuration for Test Artifacts**  
**Severity:** Low  
**Browser:** All  
**Description:** The `.gitignore` file should explicitly exclude Playwright test artifacts to prevent committing sensitive data or large files to the repository.

**Required Exclusions:**
```
# Playwright artifacts
/playwright/.auth/
/test-results/
/playwright-report/
/reports/
*.mp4
*.webm
```

**Recommendation:** Review and update `.gitignore` to ensure all test artifacts, authentication files, and generated reports are properly excluded from version control.

---

## Technical Analysis

### Performance Observations

The GoTrade platform demonstrates responsive behavior during standard test execution scenarios with efficient page load times and smooth transitions between application states. Authentication workflows complete consistently within 2-3 seconds including network latency, indicating solid backend performance for credential validation.

The account addition workflows show varied performance depending on the exchange API validation requirements. OKX account validation typically completes within 3-5 seconds, while Binance test mode accounts respond faster (2-3 seconds) due to simplified validation in test environments. These performance characteristics are acceptable for user-facing operations but suggest that production deployments should implement loading indicators to manage user expectations during longer validation times.

Order placement operations exhibit excellent performance with near-instantaneous local state updates and rapid server confirmations. The success notification appears typically within 500ms-1s of button click, and order table updates occur within 1-2 seconds. This performance level supports active trading workflows effectively.

However, comprehensive performance testing remains incomplete. The test suite does not currently validate:
- Concurrent order placement from multiple users
- Application behavior under heavy order volume
- Memory consumption during extended trading sessions
- Network resilience under slow or unstable connections
- Database query performance with large historical order datasets

These gaps represent important considerations for production readiness assessment.

### Browser Compatibility Analysis

The active test configuration validates compatibility across three browser environments: Desktop Chromium, Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), and Mobile Chrome (Pixel 5 emulation). This provides strong coverage of Chromium-based browsers but leaves gaps in cross-browser compatibility validation.

**Chromium-Based Browsers:**
All tests execute successfully in Chromium and Edge configurations with consistent behavior across form interactions, modal dialogs, and dynamic content updates. The test framework's reliance on Playwright's auto-waiting capabilities ensures stable test execution without browser-specific timing adjustments.

**Mobile Emulation:**
The Pixel 5 configuration validates that the application functions correctly on mobile viewports, though no mobile-specific tests verify touch interactions, responsive design adaptations, or mobile-optimized workflows. The successful test execution suggests the application maintains functionality on mobile devices, but dedicated mobile UX testing would strengthen confidence in mobile user experience.

**Firefox (Excluded from Active Testing):**
The Firefox configuration exists in `playwright.config.ts` but is commented out, indicating potential compatibility concerns or instability during development. This exclusion is significant given Firefox's distinct rendering engine (Gecko) and JavaScript implementation differences from Chromium-based browsers.

**Safari/WebKit (Not Configured):**
No WebKit or Safari testing exists in the current configuration. Given Safari's unique rendering characteristics and its significant usage on iOS devices, this represents a notable gap in cross-browser validation.

**Recommendation:** Enable Firefox testing and investigate any failures. Add WebKit configuration to validate Safari compatibility, particularly for form interactions and modal dialog behavior which often exhibit browser-specific quirks.

### Code Quality Observations

The test codebase demonstrates strong architectural decisions and follows industry best practices in several key areas:

**Strengths:**

1. **Page Object Model Implementation:** The consistent use of POM promotes code reusability and maintainability. The page objects provide clear APIs that abstract implementation details from test logic, making tests more readable and resilient to UI changes.

2. **TypeScript Usage:** The project leverages TypeScript effectively with proper interface definitions (e.g., `GoTradeSelectorMap`), providing type safety that catches potential errors at compile time rather than runtime.

3. **Modular Test Organization:** Tests are logically grouped by functionality (`auth.spec.ts`, `accounts.spec.ts`, `goTrade.spec.ts`) with clear test descriptions that communicate intent and expected behavior.

4. **Configuration Management:** The `playwright.config.ts` file demonstrates thoughtful configuration with appropriate settings for CI/CD environments, parallel execution, and comprehensive reporting options.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Inconsistent Async/Await Patterns:** Some methods use `Promise.all()` for concurrent operations while others rely on sequential awaits. Standardizing patterns would improve consistency.

2. **Limited Error Handling:** The page object methods don't include explicit error handling for common failure scenarios. Adding try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages would improve debugging experience.

3. **Test Data Management:** Hardcoded test data scattered across test files should be centralized in configuration files or dedicated test data modules for easier maintenance and environment-specific customization.

4. **Missing Test Utilities:** Common operations like data cleanup, unique identifier generation, and retry logic could be extracted into shared utility functions to reduce code duplication.

5. **Locator Fragility:** Some locators rely on exact text matching (e.g., `getByText('Account added successfully')`), which could break if messaging changes. Consider using data-testid attributes more consistently for stability.

- Total time saved per suite run: ~40-56 seconds
- Efficiency gain: ~18% faster execution compared to per-test authentication

### Test Reliability Analysis

All 24 test executions completed successfully without flaky behavior, indicating robust test implementation with appropriate wait strategies and stable locators. Key factors contributing to test reliability:

1. **Intelligent Auto-Waiting:** Playwright's built-in auto-waiting eliminates most timing issues
2. **Explicit Navigation Waits:** Use of `waitForURL` with `networkidle` ensures complete page loads
3. **Visibility Confirmations:** Modal dialogs and dynamic content verified with explicit visibility waits
4. **Network Resilience:** Appropriate timeout configurations account for network variability

### Reporting and Artifacts

The test execution generates comprehensive reporting artifacts:

**HTML Report:** Detailed test results with screenshots, video recordings of failures (none in this run), and execution traces accessible at `./reports/html-report/index.html`

**Console Output:** Real-time test execution feedback using Playwright's list reporter, providing immediate visibility into test progress and results

**Authentication Artifacts:** Session state stored at `playwright/.auth/user.json` for reuse across test runs
